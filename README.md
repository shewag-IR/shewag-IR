🛡️ SOC L1 Incident Reports – Hands-On Blue Team Practice
This repository contains realistic SOC Level-1 incident reports created from hands-on investigations performed in a production-style SOC lab environment.
All reports are based on real log evidence, SIEM detections, and end-to-end incident handling — from alert triage to containment and recommendations.
This is not theory or CTF-only content.
It reflects how an L1 SOC analyst actually works in real environments.
👤 About Me
Aspiring SOC Analyst (L1) with hands-on experience in:
Alert triage and investigation
Log analysis across endpoint, network, and web layers
Evidence-based incident reporting
Operating and comparing multiple SIEM platforms
I actively practice SOC workflows using SIEM, EDR, IDS, and host telemetry, simulating real enterprise incidents across Windows, Linux, and web environments.
